# Crime Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes crime data in Denver to understand crime patterns, trends, and distribution across different districts and seasons. The goal is to provide insights that can help improve law enforcement strategies and resource allocation.

## Project Objectives
The analysis aims to answer key questions related to crime trends, such as:
1. What are the trends in crime rates over the years, months, and weeks?
2. Are there significant increases or decreases in crime rates over time?
3. Are there specific times of the day when certain crimes occur more frequently?
4. What are the most common crime types in different districts and neighborhoods?
5. How does the frequency of each crime type change over time?
6. Are certain crime types more common in specific seasons?
7. What is the seasonal variation in crime rates?
8. Is there a relationship between weather conditions and crime occurrences?
9. Do certain crimes occur more frequently on cold or rainy days?
10. Are there significant differences in crime rates and types between different cities?
